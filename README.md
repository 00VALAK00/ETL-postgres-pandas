# ETL Pipeline Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. In this ETL pipeline, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Extract Data**: We extract data from a web URL and save it into a CSV file.

2. **Load Data into Database**: We load the extracted data into a PostgreSQL database.

3. **Perform Data Transformations**: We perform necessary data transformations on the extracted data.

4. **Write Transformed Data to Database**: We write the resulting transformed data into the PostgreSQL database.

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to use this ETL pipeline:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/etl-pipeline.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
Have fun
